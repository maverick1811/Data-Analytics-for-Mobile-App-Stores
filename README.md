This project is based on the guided project of the course "Python for Data Science: Fundamentals" on dataquest.io.

This is my first python project, so I'm doing it mainly to practice and master the fundamentals of python.  Here the dataset used is the Google Play Store data from a few years ago.  

The aim of the projects are: 
* To open, read and handle datasets
* To clean the data set
* To understand the structure of datasets
* To become familiar with the basic tools of python such as the various data types, loops, methods and functions
* To create useful (but basic) statistics based on the data provided
