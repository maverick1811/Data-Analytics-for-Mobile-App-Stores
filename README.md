Hi, this is my first python project. I did it mainly to practice and master the fundamentals of python. Here the dataset used is the Google Play Store data from a few years ago.

This project is based on the guided project of the course "Python for Data Science: Fundamentals" on dataquest.io.

The aim of the projects are:

1. To open, read and handle datasets
2. To clean the data set
3. To understand the structure of datasets
4. To become familiar with the basic tools of python such as the various data types, loops, methods and functions
5. To create useful (but basic) statistics based on the data provided
